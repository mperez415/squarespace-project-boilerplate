## Project Overview
Use this project as a boilerplate for all of your Squarespace projects.

### What's In This Repo?
This repo is an basic, top-level dev-tools project which includes a Base Squarespace template, with example files. `project-title` would be your root project directory. This project is set up to be managed by bitbucket, but that can be easiliy changed by swapping out bitbucket links with github links. These changes would need to be made to the top-level README, and package.json file.

After cloning this repo, run a Find & Replace on the following:

* PROJECT_TITLE - Replace with your Project's Title
* PROJECT_URL - Replace with your Project's production URL.
* BITBUCKET_USERNAME - Replace with the primary Bitbucket account you work in.
