#Collections
---
Collections are used by your template to create information feeds.  

Collections require at least one .list/item file (or both for separate item & list views), and a .conf file. See [Squarespace documentation](http://developers.squarespace.com/collections/) for more information.

Any .block files placed here will be copied to template ==> blocks.
