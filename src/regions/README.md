#Regions
---
Regions are used by your template to manipulate the actual layout of your site.  

Your site requires at least 1 region. You can also optionally break your site into multiple regions. See [Squarespace documentation](http://developers.squarespace.com/layouts-regions/) for more information.

Any .region files placed here will be copied to the top level in the template directory.
